# GitHub::Actions [![Checks the github action using itself](https://github.com/JJ/perl-GitHub-Actions/actions/workflows/self-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JJ/perl-GitHub-Actions/actions/workflows/self-test.yml)

Use GitHub Actions workflow commands directly from Perl, generally using the
system Perl included in the runner.

## INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


## DEPENDENCIES

None (intentionally).


## HOW TO

After installation, use `perldoc GitHub::Actions` for the commands available
(generally a camel_cased version of the corresponding GitHub Action commands).

If you want to use this inside a GitHub action, you will have to use fatpack to
create a single command.
