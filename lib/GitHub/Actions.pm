=head1 NAME

GitHub::Actions - Work in GitHub Actions using Perl


=head1 VERSION

This document describes GitHub::Actions version 0.1.1.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use GitHub::Actions;
    use v5.14;

    # Imported %github contains all GITHUB_* environment variables
    for my $g (keys %github ) {
       say "GITHUB_$g -> ", $github{$g}
    }

    # Set step output
    set_output("FOO", "BAR");

    # Set environment variable value
    set_env("FOO", "BAR");

    # Produces an error and sets exit code to 1
    error( "FOO has happened" );

    # Error/warning with information on file
    error_on_file( "There's foo", $file, $line, $col );
    warning_on_file( "There's bar", $file, $line, $col );

    # Debugging messages and warnings
    debug( "Value of FOO is $bar" );
    warning( "Value of FOO is $bar" );

    # Start and end group
    start_group( "Foo" );
    # do stuff
    end_group;

    # Exits with error if that's the case
    exit_action();

    # Errors and exits
    set_failed( "We're doomed" );

Install this module within a GitHub action

      . name: "Install GitHub::Actions"
        run: sudo cpan GitHub::Actions

(we need C<sudo> since we're using the system Perl)

You can use this as a C<step>

      - name: Test env variables
        shell: perl {0}
        run: |
          use GitHub::Actions;
          set_env( 'FOO', 'BAR');

In most cases, you'll want to just have it installed locally and fatpack it to
upload it to the repository.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GitHub Actions include by default, at least in its Linux runners, a
system Perl which you can use directly in your GitHub actions. This here is
a (for the time being) minimalistic module that tries to help a bit
with that, by defining a few functions that will be useful when
performing GitHub actions. Besides the system Perl, you can use any of
L<the modules
installed|https://gist.github.com/JJ/edf3a39d68525439978da2a02763d42b>. You
can install other modules via cpan or, preferably for speed, via the
Ubuntu package (or equivalent)

Check out an example of using it in the L<repository|https://github.com/JJ/perl-GitHub-Actions/blob/main/.github/workflows/self-test.yml>

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 set_env( $env_var_name, $env_var_value)

This is equivalent to
L<setting an environment variable|https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-environment-variable>

=head2 set_output( $output_name, $output_value)

Equivalent to L<C<set_output>|https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-output-parameter>

=head2 debug( $debug_message )

Equivalent to L<C<debug>|https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-a-debug-message>

=head2 error( $error_message )

Equivalent to
L<C<error>|https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-error-message>,
prints an error message. Remember to call L<exit_action()> to make the step fail
if there's been some error.

=head2 warning( $warning_message )

Equivalent to L<C<warning>|https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-a-warning-message>, simply prints a warning.

=head2 command_on_file( $error_message, $file, $line, $col )

Common code for L<error_on_file> and L<warning_on_file>. Can be used for any future commands.

=head2 error_on_file( $error_message, $file, $line, $col )

Equivalent to L<C<error>|https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-error-message>, prints an error message with file and line info

=head2 warning_on_file( $warning_message, $file, $line, $col )

Equivalent to L<C<warning>|https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-a-warning-message>, prints an warning with file and line info.

=head2 set_failed( $error_message )

Exits with an error status of 1 after setting the error message.

=head2 start_group( $group_name )

Starts a group in the logs, grouping the following messages. Corresponds to
L<C<group>|https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#grouping-log-lines>.

=head2 end_group

Ends current log grouping.

=head2 exit_action

Exits with the exit code generated during run, that is, 1 if there's been any
error reported.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

GitHub::Actions requires no configuration files or environment
variables. Those set by GitHub Actions will only be available there,
or if you set them explicitly. Remember that they will need to be set
during the C<BEGIN> phase to be available when this module loads.

    BEGIN {
      $ENV{'GITHUB_FOO'} = 'foo';
      $ENV{'GITHUB_BAR'} = 'bar';
    }


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Intentionally, no dependencies are included.


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
